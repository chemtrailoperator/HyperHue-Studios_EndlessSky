Essentially, this plugin gives the player access to all 29 vanilla swizzles in-game. Future versions may include custom swizzles like different cloaking patterns.
Gameplay:
  To start the mission chain, visit any vanilla human planet.
  To change your ship's colors, choose a color you like in the shipyard tab and then accept the "Repaint Your Ship!" job in the job board. A conversation will appear from there and you can select it.
Future Versions may also change the gameplay dynamic, forcing you to have certain reputation and licenses for paint schemes.
