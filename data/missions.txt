			`When you land on Mars, HyperHue Studios is a very prominent building, bright, flashy, and situated directly in the Spaceport. When you get there, you are handed a brochure that gives instructions on how to get your ship repainted: first, select a color you like in the shipyard display, and then purchase the corresponding paint job in the Job Board.`
